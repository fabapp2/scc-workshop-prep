## Spring Cloud Contract - an overview

Spring Cloud Contract uses a contract DSL to generate

* a test that verifies the specified behaviour of an producer (API provider)
* a stub which provides the defined behaviour for tests of the API consumer

image::media/drawings/2.png[]

When testing the client Spring Cloud Contract provides the stub to simulate the producer.
The test has to provide information where the stub implementation provided by SCC can be found.

For tests of the producer SCC generates a test which extends base class that has to be provided.
The base has to setup the application for the generated test, e.g. start the application context define mock behaviour and so on.

## The example

## Workshop setup

* Fork the workshop GIT repositories: +
`git fork {producer-git-repo}` and +
`git fork ${consumer-git-repo}`. +
* Open the projects in your IDE
* Open the workshop PDF found in the root of the project

## Exercise - running the example
* Have a look at the contract in the `consumer` project.
* Run the producer and look at the generated test and the base class it extends
* Verify that a jar with the stub was generated and exists in the `target` directory of the `producer`
* The generated jar with the stubs will be required to run the `consumer` test. +
 Install the generated stub in the local maven repository by doing a `mvn install`. +
 The `consumer` expects the stubs in the local maven repository +
 (per default under ``<user direcory>/.m2/repository`).

NOTE: We could add a StockSymbol Service which provides available stock symbols and let the StockWatchService check if a given stock symbol is valid to generate errors

## Exercise - delete stock price watch watch (REST)

## Exercise - delete stock price watch watch (messaging)
## Exercise - change id from long to UUID




[TIP]
It's possible to use Unicode glyphs as admonition icons.

## RestAssured vs. Wiremock vs MockMvc ?

By default, the Spring Cloud Contract Plugin uses Rest Assured’s MockMvc setup for the generated tests.
Since non-Spring applications do not use MockMvc, you can change the testMode to EXPLICIT to send a real request to an application bound at a specific port.

NOTE: https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-contract/reference/html/using.html#flows-provider-non-spring-producer


# Use "real" Servlet Container with EXPLICIT testMode:

  <testMode>EXPLICIT</testMode>
  <baseClassForTests>com.example.scc.producer.HelloServiceSccBase</baseClassForTests>
</configuration>
</plugin>

`Base class`

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)
@DirtiesContext
public class HelloServiceSccBase {

  @LocalServerPort
  private long port;

  @BeforeEach
  public void setup() {
      RestAssured.baseURI = "http://localhost:" + this.port;

  MockMvc mockMvc;

## Example

. Customer orders Coffee
. Cashier receives Money
. Cashier hands out QueueNumber to Customer
. Barista receives Order
. Barista prepares Order
. Barista hands our Order


## Setup

* Checkout provided Git Repositories
* Create projects in your IDE.

TIP: Installing Groovy to your system allows you to use GroovyConsole to experiment e.g. with Regex.

## Exercise - Create and use a REST contract on the producer side.

In a first step we'll use the contract on the producer side.
This is the simplest but already valuable step.

. Start with a very simple Producer application
. Add a contract and configure the build to generate tests
. Provide base class
. Generate the test
. Fix the test

NOTE: Look into generated classes (tests and stubs)

## Exercise - Use the generated (wiremock) stubs on client side

Second, we'll leverage the generated stubs and use it to test a consumer using the previously generated stubs.

Configure the client build using `Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner`

[source, xml]
--
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-contract-stub-runner</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
--

Write a Spring integration test using the generated stubs

. Use `StubsMode.LOCAL` and SCC will try to resolve the stubs from local maven repository (`~/.m2repository`)
. We need to pass the URL including the randomly chosen port of the created stub using `${stubrunner.runningstubs.producer.port}`. It can be passed to Spring using `properties`

[source, java]
--
@SpringBootTest(properties = "producer.url=http://localhost:${stubrunner.runningstubs.producer.port}")
@AutoConfigureStubRunner(
		ids = "com.example.scc:producer:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:stubs",
		stubsMode = StubRunnerProperties.StubsMode.LOCAL)
class ConsumerApplicationTests {

	@Autowired
	ConsumerOfHelloService consumerOfHelloService;

	@Test
	void contextLoads() {
		consumerOfHelloService.useHelloService("Hello");
	}

}
--


## Exercise - Create and use a Messaging contract

Implement messaging on the Producer side and verify that message is sent to `Sink` using integration test with test binder and contract.



[source, java]
----
@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier // <1>
public class HelloServiceSccBase {...}
----

<1> You need to add `@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier` to the base class to initialise messaging support for scc.
<2> and provide a contract for messaging

[source, java]
----

----

QUESTION: clarify what role the label plays


`NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type 'org.springframework.cloud.contract.verifier.messaging.internal.ContractVerifierMessaging<?>' available: expected at least 1 bean which qualifies as autowire candidate. Dependency annotations: {@javax.inject.Inject()}``

NOTE: solved by adding `@AutoConfigureMessageVerifier` to base class


## Exercise - Add header field with timestamp and compare using a method in base class

[source, java]
----
// output message of the contract
    outputMessage {
        // destination to which the output message will be sent
        sentTo('output')
        // the body of the output message
        body("Hello")
        // the headers of the output message
        headers {
            header('some', $(producer(execute('assertDoubleEqualsWithTolerance($it, 80)')))) <1>
        }
    }
----

<1> using `execute(...)` lets you execute a method in base class, `$it` provides the current value into it.

[source, java]
----
public void assertDoubleEqualsWithTolerance(String it, int tolerance) {
    assertThat(System.currentTimeMillis() - Double.valueOf(it) < tolerance); <1>
}
----

<1> we can then provide a method in the base class doing assertions on the given value and additional parameters if required.

## Exercise - provide a base class for each contract

For now we use one base class for our REST contract and for the messaging contract.
We might want to separate things and provide a base class for each contract.
Let's go...

. Provide a package `baseclasses` in `src/test/java` for all your base classes.
. Split up the `HelloServiceSccBase` class in two classes, one for your Rest contract and one for your Messaging contract. +
Name the messaging base class `MessagingBase` and the rest base class `RestBase`. Both base classes must reside in the `baseclasses` package.
. Change your `spring-cloud-contract-maven-plugin` configuration. +
Remove or comment out the `<baseClassForTests>` property and provide a `<packageWithBaseClasses>` property which has the package with your base classes as value.
. Run the build so the contract tests get recreated. Use `-DskipTests` if the tests are failing (which should not be the case).
. Verify that there's a `MessagingTest` and a `RestTest` class now and that the extend the dedicated base classes.

NOTE: You can find more information about how to define base classes with scc here: https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/hands-on-guide-to/9780135598436/9780135598436-HGSC_01_04_06[Define base classes with SC-Contract in Maven] and here:


## Exercise - Share the contracts through a centralised repository so it can be shared by multiple clients
